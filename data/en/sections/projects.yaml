  summary: An insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of Machine Learning, and you are asked to evaluate that possibility. Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing. Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a prediction model do better than a dummy model? Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model. Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task. It's necessary to develop a data transformation
